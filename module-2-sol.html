                <h2>Chickens</h2>
                <p>is a dish of grilled and sliced beef,
                 usually arrachera, sirloin steak, 
                 tenderloin steak or rib steak.[1] 
                 It is usually cooked with a certain amount of searing to impart a charred flavor.
                 Carne asada can be served as a main dish or as an ingredient in other dishes.
                 The term carne asada translates to "grilled meat";
                  the English "roast beef" is so named in Spanish.
                  The term "Carne asada" is used in Latin America, 
                  and refers to the style of grilled meat in those countries.
                   In South America, the term used for grilled meat is "asado", 
                   and it has a different style and preparation</p>

        <h2>Beef</h2>
        <p>Many Puerto Ricans note that arroz con pollo cannot be made without beer and annatto oil,
            and saffron is no substitute.
            Beer and annatto are rarely used in Spanish cooking and never in arroz con pollo there.
             Annatto is frequently used in Puerto Rican cooking especially in rice dishes like arroz 
             con gandules (rice with pork and pigeon peas) and arroz con maiz (rice with corn and sausage).
              Beer is used in many Puerto Rican dishes like pollo guisado (braised stewed chicken) and asopao
               de pollo (chicken rice stew). Arroz con pollo and most Puerto Rican rice dishes are highly
                seasoned with sofrito, which is another key ingredient in arroz con pollo. </p>

        <h2>Sushi</h2>
        <p>norimaki ( "Nori roll") or makimono ( "variety of rolls")
             is a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a bamboo mat known as a makisu .
              Makizushi is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed), but is occasionally wrapped in a thin
               omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso (perilla) leaves. Makizushi is usually cut into
                six or eight pieces, which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some common types of 
                makizushi, but many other kinds exist. </p>
